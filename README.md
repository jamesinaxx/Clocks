# Clocks

A various collection of html clocks designed to be embeddable anywhere (a list of available clocks is coming soon but for now just look through the code)

## Clock list

* Basic clock
* Pride clock (currently only gay pride but more pride flags are coming soon)
* Black clock
* White clock
* Transparent clock
